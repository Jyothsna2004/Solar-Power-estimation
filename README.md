### ðŸŒž Solar Power Estimation Using ARIMA

**Project Description:**

Developed a time series forecasting model using the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** algorithm to predict solar power generation based on historical solar data. The goal was to improve the efficiency and reliability of solar energy systems by providing accurate short-term and long-term estimates of solar output.

**Key Features:**

* Collected and preprocessed real-world solar power generation data (e.g., hourly/daily solar irradiance or power output).
* Conducted **time series analysis** including stationarity testing (ADF test), seasonal decomposition, and data visualization.
* Used **ARIMA modeling** for univariate forecasting, identifying optimal parameters (p, d, q) using AIC/BIC and grid search.
* Validated the model using **train-test split** and evaluated accuracy using **RMSE** and **MAE**.
* Visualized actual vs predicted solar power to assess model performance.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python, Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Statsmodels (for ARIMA)
* Jupyter/Google Colab

**Impact:**

* Provided an efficient solution for forecasting solar power to aid in energy planning and grid stability.
* Demonstrated the practical application of ARIMA in renewable energy domains.
