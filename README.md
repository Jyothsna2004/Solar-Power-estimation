# Solar-Power-estimation
Developed a time series forecasting model using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) algorithm to predict solar power generation based on historical solar data. The goal was to improve the efficiency and reliability of solar energy systems by providing accurate short-term and long-term estimates of solar output.
